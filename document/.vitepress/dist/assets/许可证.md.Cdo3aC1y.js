<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>## Preamble</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>software and other kinds of works.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>it to your programs, too.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of others.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>know their rights.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users&#39; and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>authors of previous versions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modified versions of the software inside them, although the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>aim of protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>freedom of users.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modification follow.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>## TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 0. Definitions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of works, such as semiconductor masks.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>on the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conveying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 1. Source Code</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source form of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>a work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>is widely used among developers working in that language.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>implementation is available to the public in source code form. A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>control those activities. However, it does not include the work&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>subprograms and other parts of the work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 2. Basic Permissions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>it unnecessary.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>measures.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>circumvention of technological measures.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>conditions:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    it, and giving a relevant date.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    released under this License and any conditions added under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    work need not make them do so.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>parts of the aggregate.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>ways:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    customarily used for software interchange.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Source from a network server at no charge.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    with subsection 6b.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    provided you inform other peers where the object code and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    public at no charge under subsection 6d.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>included in conveying the object code work.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;normally used&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>mode of use of the product.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>solely because modification has been made.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>been installed in ROM).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>network.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>unpacking, reading or copying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 7. Additional Terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    or authors of the material; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>- f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>    impose on those licensors and authors.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>where to find the applicable terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>above requirements apply either way.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 8. Termination</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>paragraph of section 11).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>60 days after the cessation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>your receipt of the notice.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>material under section 10.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 11. Patents</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims owned</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent against the party.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work and works based on it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>connection with specific products or compilations that contain the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>from conveying the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>combination as such.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 14. Revised Versions of this License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>detail to address new problems or concerns.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Software Foundation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#39;s public</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>choose that version for the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Later license versions may give you additional or different</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>later version.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>CORRECTION.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 16. Limitation of Liability</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>copy of the Program in return for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>terms.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>        Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span></span>
